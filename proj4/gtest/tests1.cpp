// NOTE:  these are not intended as exhaustive tests.
// This should get you started testing.

// The four tests marked "CheckPoint" are going to be run
// on your submission for the checkpoint code.
// This is worth one-sixth of your grade on the assignment
// and is due at the time marked "checkpoint"


// None of the "checkpoint" tests require you to have
// AVL functionality OR the counting of words.
// Implementing your tree as a plain binary search
// tree is more than enough to pass these tests.

// Of course, you are expected to implement AVL functionality
// for the full project.

// BE SURE TO FULLY TEST YOUR CODE.
// This means making sure your templating is not hard-coding for 
// a specific type, that every function is called somewhere in 
// your test cases, etc. 
// There will NOT be a project 2 style redo for this;  if your 
//  code does not compile, your score will be a zero.
